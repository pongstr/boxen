Our Boxen
---

Okay, before even reading further below, Make sure you have XCode installed and
had verified installation via gui first! and then install XCode Commandline tools
via gui!! once done, read further below to proceed with Boxen.

If you already have an idea what Boxen is what this repo does,
please proceed to [Bootstrapping](#bootstrapping) otherwise you may
head to [boxen/our-boxen](https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen) to get
an idea how it works and the benefits of having it.

## Bootstrapping

1. Go to TORO-IO Boxen web: [https://toro-boxen.herokuapp.com](https://toro-boxen.herokuapp.com)
1. Login using your Github account
1. Copy + Paste the one liner to your Terminal
1. Grab a coffee

**Or Manually**

```
$ sudo mkdir -p /opt/boxen
$ sudo chown ${USER}:staff /opt/boxen
$ git clone https://github.com/toroio/boxen.git /opt/boxen/repo && cd /opt/boxen/repo

# Run the Bootstrap
$ ./script/boxen-bootstrap

# Run Boxen
# @param: --no-fde # skip filevault disk encryption
# @param: --debug  # see the behind the scene action
$ ./script/boxen
```

once done, you may add the line below to your config file:
`.zshrc` or `.bashrc`

```bash
[ -f /opt/boxen/env.sh ] && source /opt/boxen/env.sh
```

Once your shell is ready, open a new tab/window in your Terminal
and you should be able to successfully run `boxen --env`.
If that runs cleanly, you're in good shape.


Customizing the Boxen
---
\'this version of boxen is now a scalable one. Means it will be easier to add application on user, group, or all'/

To Add an App:
  first is to categorized your needed app based on your provider: [Puppet], [casks], or [homebrew].
  second is to categorized who will benefit to the application: (user), (group) or (all).

We will be using HIERA to customize the Boxen

User)
    Add an application declaration using hiera/users/$USERNAME.yaml

      declare if [puppet]
          boxen::personal:includes:
            - $app_name
      declare if [casks]
          boxen::personal::casks:
            - $app_name
      declare if [homebrew]
          boxen::personal::homebrew_packages:

Group)
    Add the application inside " --{''} ""

All)
    Add the declaration using hiera/common.yaml

But you may smoothly set this up by using this [dotfile](https://github.com/pongstr/dotfiles/blob/master/init/.gituser)
like so:

```bash
# Download the file
$ curl -L -o setup https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pongstr/dotfiles/master/init/.gituser

# Make it executable and run it, follow instructions and you're golden
$ chmod +x setup && ./setup
```
